Sherlock is an open source data platform, developed in the [Korcsmaros Group](http://www.earlham.ac.uk/korcsmaros-group) (Earlham Institute, Norwich, UK) to store, analyze and integrate bioinformatics data.


### Features
* **store** all datasets in a redundant, organized cloud storage
* **convert** all datasets to common, optimized file formats
* **execute** analytical queries on top of data files
* **share** datasets among different teams / projects
* **generate** operational datasets for certain services or collaborators


### High-level overview and presentations
